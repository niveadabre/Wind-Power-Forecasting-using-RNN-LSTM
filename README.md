##Project Topic : Wind-Power-Forecasting-using-RNN-LSTM

Wind power is one of the most promising renewable energy sources, it is clean, safe, and
inexhaustible. Short term forecasting in the renewable energy sector is becoming increasingly
important. With renewables penetrating the market faster than expected, and the inherent
uncertainty involved with weather forecasts, it is putting a lot of strain on the existing energy
providers and distributors to both manage and balance the power grid. Doing so efficiently
requires accurate knowledge of both supply and demand.

As both are future events,forecasting is required to predict these factors. Energy demand is a more stable signal than
supply of renewable energy which is based on local weather systems relative to the energy
generation. Of course, demand can also spike unexpectedly with events such as extreme
weather spells. Bad predictions can cause energy providers to end up with a shortfall in
supply which means they will be required to generate the shortfall by burning more expensive
and less climate friendly fuels. It can also result in large oversupply where the company is
burning fuel needlessly with is both bad economically and for the climate. Therefore, better
predictions in the [1, 24] hour time horizon are central to efficiently balancing supply and
demand in the energy grid.


However, predicting wind signal has always been challenging because the time series data is
nonlinear, non-stationary and chaotic. In this report, I provide a novel predicting framework
including a recurrent neural network (RNN) structure model with long, short term memory
(LSTM) units and an effective forecasting map adapted to different prediction horizons.
I compare our new approach with concurrent methods like Random forest Regression model
and show that our new method is more effective in forecasting wind power.
